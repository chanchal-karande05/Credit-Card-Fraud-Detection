🛡️ Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning


📌 Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning classification techniques.
It demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, with a strong focus on handling imbalanced datasets, which are common in real-world fraud detection problems.

🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies transactions as Fraud or Non-Fraud, while prioritizing recall to minimize missed fraud cases.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Google Collab Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset

Transaction-level dataset with labeled fraud and non-fraud cases

Highly imbalanced, reflecting real-world financial data

Features are numerical and anonymized for privacy

🔍 Project Workflow

Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Handling class imbalance

Model training

Model evaluation using appropriate classification metrics

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Due to class imbalance, the following metrics are used instead of accuracy alone:

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix
